# HR Analytics

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this data analysis project is to identify and analyze the key factors contributing to employee attrition within the company. By delving into the data and applying analytical techniques, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that shed light on why employees leave the company. The insights gained from this analysis will inform strategic decision-making processes to mitigate attrition and improve employee retention.

## Data Source

Employee Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "HR_Analytics.csv" file, containing comprehensive information about the employees of a company.

## Tools

- Microsoft Excel - Data Cleaning & Data Analysis
- Microsoft PowerBI - Creating Dashboard

## Data Cleaning/Preparation

During the initial data preparation stage, several steps were undertaken to ensure the quality and integrity of the dataset:

1. Data Loading and Inspection: The dataset was loaded into the analysis environment, and an initial exploratory analysis was conducted to understand its structure, variables, and potential issues.
2. Handling Missing Values: Missing values were identified across the dataset, and appropriate strategies were employed to address them, ensuring minimal impact on subsequent analyses.
3. Removal of Redundant Columns: One column containing information on "Years with current manager" was removed due to its numerous null values and lack of relevance to the analysis objectives.
4. Duplicate Removal: Duplicate entries within the dataset were identified and removed to prevent bias and ensure accuracy in subsequent analyses.
5. Standardization of Categorical Values: Inconsistencies in categorical values were addressed, specifically instances where "Travel_Rarely" was inconsistently represented as "TravelRarely" in the "Business Travel" column. These were standardized to "Travel_Rarely" to maintain consistency and accuracy in the dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involves exploring the employee data to answer key questions such as:

- What is the Attrition Rate of the Company?
- What is the salary slab of the employees leaving the company?
- What is the age group they lie in?
- Which department is showing the maximum attrition?
- How many years have they spent with the company?
