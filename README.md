# HR Analytics

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this data analysis project is to identify and analyze the key factors contributing to employee attrition within the company. By delving into the data and applying analytical techniques, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that shed light on why employees leave the company. The insights gained from this analysis will inform strategic decision-making processes to mitigate attrition and improve employee retention.

## Data Source

Employee Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "HR_Analytics.csv" file, containing comprehensive information about the employees of a company.

## Tools

- Microsoft Excel - Data Cleaning & Data Analysis
- Microsoft PowerBI - Creating Dashboard

## Data Cleaning
- Removed one row (Years with current manager) as it had several null values and it was not needed for the analysis.
- Removed duplicates from the file.
- In some instances, Travel_Rarely was written as TravelRarely, replaced with Travel_Rarely in the Business Travel column.
